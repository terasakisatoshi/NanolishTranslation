# What is `Nanolish` ?

- `Nanolish` is a extremely simpilified natural language. Nanolish primarily is used by Japanese Virtual YouTuber [Luna(姫森ルーナ)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa9Y57gfeY0Zro_noHRVrnw) in her stream. She uses it to talk to people around the world, not just Japanese. According to [this video](https://youtu.be/Z8_LqTzWNOg?t=138), `Nanolish is a best of English`. Note that the words in `Nanolish` are the same as the English words.

- English is spoken all over the world. This is an indisputable fact. However, I think it is difficult to explain from this fact that the standard English used by the people in the world is the best one. Standard English has a more complex grammar than Nanolish and uses many more words to explain certain concepts (how many characters did I use in standard English to describe Nanolish in this README?). Standard English tends to make it difficult for non-English speakers to hear because it forces them to speak quickly. Nanolish reduces the number of words used by the speaker to put them in the context of the video. In fact, the Nanolish speaker, Luna, does not use a lot of words. The speed at which each word is spoken can be reduced, making it easier for non-standard English speakers to understand. In fact, Luna say Nanolish slowly.
- Many overseas bros (a.k.a 海外ニキ in Japanese) is making funny clips of Luna's stream and trying to understand what she says (Thank you BROS). Due to the simplicity of Nanolish, some English speakers seem to find Nanolish difficult to understand. We usually express things in an ostentatious and difficult language, which may make it difficult for us to understand them in a simplified language. With the arrival of Nanolish, we have been reminded of this important proposition, which we have not been aware of because we think it is commonplace.
- To solve this fatal problem(I mean "To help more people understand Nanolish"), I created a translation table for Nanolish based on a YouTube video.
The similarities between the Japanese author of this repository and Luna's Japanese identity make listening to Nanolish easier. We hope this repository will help to prove that `Nanolish is a best of English`.
